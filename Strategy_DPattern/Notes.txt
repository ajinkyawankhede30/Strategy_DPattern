Strategy Design Pattern

1. It is a behavioral design pattern that enables client to select algorithm at runtime
2. It defines a family of algoithm, encapsulates each one of its own implementation, and make them interchageable
3. This pattern allow algorithm to be modifies without affecting the clients that rely on it.


Benifits:
1.Enhances felxibility and reusabilit through dynamic algorithm substitution
2.Simplifies unit testing and maintenance by isolating complex algorithms


How to implement?
1. Create the strategy interface
2. Create one or more implementation
3. Use the strategy through its interface
